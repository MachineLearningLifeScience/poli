# `poli` üß™, a library for discrete objective functions

[![Testing (conda, python 3.9)](https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/poli/actions/workflows/python-tox-testing-including-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/poli/actions/workflows/python-tox-testing-including-conda.yml)

`poli` is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play library to query black-box functions in biology and cheminformatics. Examples include:
- Computing the **stability** of mutations from a wildtype protein (using `foldx`).
- Computing the **docking scores** of ligands to proteins (using [`pyscreener`](https://github.com/coleygroup/pyscreener) and [`pytdc`](https://tdcommons.ai/functions/oracles/)).

When dependencies get tough, this library provides a way to encapsulate objective functions into isolated `conda` environments. The main benefit is that this allows to develop optimization algorithms that use (say) tensorflow without having to worry about the specific dependencies of the objective function. Moreover, `poli` provides a way to inject logging into the objective function evaluations using observers.

## Getting started

To install `poli`, we recommend creating a fresh conda environment

```bash
conda create -n poli-base python=3.9
conda activate poli-base
pip install git+https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/poli.git@dev
```

To check if everything went well, you can run

```bash
$ python -c "from poli.core.registry import get_problems ; print(get_problems(only_available=True))"
['aloha', ..., 'white_noise']
```

### Minimal working example

Defining an objective function that just returns a draw from a standard normal.
```python
# Check examples/minimal_working_example.py
import numpy as np
from poli import objective_factory

problem_info, f, x0, y0, run_info = objective_factory.create(name="white_noise")

x = np.array([["1", "2", "3"]])  # must be of shape [b, L], in this case [1, 3].
for _ in range(5):
    print(f"f(x) = {f(x)}")

```

## Where can I find the documentation?

### Building the documentation locally

If you install the `requirements-dev.txt` via

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

then you will have access to `sphinx`. You should be able to build the documentation by going to the docs folder and building it:

```bash
cd docs/
make html
```

Afterwards, you can enter the `build` folder and open `index.html`.
