# Using `foldx` for predicting stability.

This is an example of how to define a black box function (and problem) that queries `foldx` in the process.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, you must have installed/downloaded `foldx`, and you should have the following files in your home directory:
- `~/foldx/foldx`, i.e. the binary of `foldx`, and
- `~/foldx/rotabase.txt`.

We also use the following Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install biopython numpy
```
