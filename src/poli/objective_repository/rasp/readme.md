# `RaSP`, Rapid Stability Predictions

This objective function was first discussed in [TODO: ADD](), where the authors propose a deep learning-based way of assessing single mutations from proteins.

We implement it by bringing their (old) [open source implementation](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/papers/tree/main/2022/ML-ddG-Blaabjerg-et-al), and adapting it to `poli`'s set-up. The code is thus mostly theirs.

## We'll need `clang`

## We clone a repo, so we need `git`

## How to use

TODO: write.
